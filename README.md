# :pencil2: Meme generator ðŸ”§

#### This is a project I developed for a full-stack web development course at [@betrybe](https://github.com/betrybe) to show my grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

In this project you can choose one of four meme templates, or upload you own, and customize it with white impact text and/or a colorful border.
At the moment you can't export anything.

The files I developed are:
  - index.html
  - script.js
  - style.css
  - this README
I also added the imgs directory and its contents

All other files and directories were developed by [@betrybe](https://github.com/betrybe)
